Makes your life easier optimizing an application for retina displays.

How it works
------------

Retina Rails makes your application use high-resolution images by default. It automatically optimizes uploaded images (CarrierWave or Paperclip) for retina displays by making them twice the size and reducing the quality.

Installation
------------

1. Add `gem 'retina_rails', '~> 2.0.0'` to your Gemfile.
1. Run `bundle install`.

Migrations
------------

Add a text column named `retina_dimensions`. This column is used to store original dimensions of the images.

```ruby
class AddRetinaDimensionsColumnsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    add_column :users, :retina_dimensions, :text
  end

  def self.down
    remove_column :users, :retina_dimensions, :text
  end
end
```

CarrierWave
------------

Simply add `retina!` to your uploader.

```ruby
class ExampleUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base

  retina!

  version :small do
    process :resize_to_fill => [30, 30]
    process :retina_quality => 25
  end

  version :large, :retina => false do
    process :resize_to_fill => [1000, 1000]
  end

end
```

By default it sets the retina image quality to 40 which can be overriden with `process :retina_quality => 25`. To disable the creation of a retina version simply call `version :small, :retina => false`.

### Custom resize processors

You can also use your custom resize processors like so:

```ruby
class ExampleUploader < CarrierWave::Uploader::Base

  retina!

  version :small, :retina => false do
    process :resize_to_fill_with_gravity => [200, 200, 'North', :jpg, 75]
    process :store_retina_dimensions
  end

end
```

Make sure you double the image size yourself in your processor. In this example the image will be displayed with a size of 100x100.


Paperclip
------------

Simply add `retina!` to your model.

```ruby
class ExampleUploader < ActiveRecord::Base

  retina!

  has_attached_file :image,
    :styles => {
       :original => ["800x800", :jpg],
       :small => ["125x125#", :jpg]
     },
     :retina => { :quality => 25 }

end
```

By default it sets the retina image quality to 40 which can be overriden by adding a `quality` option. To disable the creation of a retina version set the `retina` option to false `:retina => false`.

Displaying a retina image
------------

```ruby
retina_image_tag(@user, :image, :small, :default => { :width => 50, :height => 40 })
```

If no image is uploaded (yet) it will display the default image defined with CarrierWave or Paperclip and set the width and height attributes specified in the default option.

**Voila! Now you're using Retina Rails.**
